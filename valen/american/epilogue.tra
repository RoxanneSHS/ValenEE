@999999 = ~After parting from <CHARNAME>, Valen wandered aimlessly for a time.  Lacking focus, she was barely more dangerous than an ordinary fledgling vampire, and the people of Tethyr never learned that this particular dark legend had its origin in their land.  Valen finally found something that motivated her; she buried herself in lust for power, not so much because she desired power for herself, but for the memory of how it had obsessed Bodhi.  In the Dalelands, she founded a thieves' guild that duelled with the Zhentarim and the Harpers alike, and was just beginning to draw personal attention from Fzoul Chembryl when it collapsed, abandoned by its founder.

Valen had discovered that the benefits of world-shaking levels of power and infamy, to her mind, were outweighed by the high profile that came with them.  She retired quietly to Athkatla, and there, she secretly dominated the revived Shadow Thieves' Guild, the Council of Six, and even the Cowled Wizards.  To most of the people of Athkatla, life continued as it always had; the corruption of the city was already so great that, as long as they stayed indoors at night, Valen's rule changed little.

Valen drank deeply of blood and power both--not the epic power Bodhi had sought, but all the power she needed or wanted for herself.  If, occasionally, a tear came to her eye as she contemplated her portrait of the dark, luminous figure who had led her into damnation, no one ever saw it.

Of the life and unlife of Valen, no more is known.  There are many legends of her fall, and each attributes her final death to a different figure, whether Drizzt Do'Urden, Elminster, or another who once travelled with <CHARNAME>.  The most persistent and quiet rumours whisper that she was not destroyed at all, that she still rules Athkatla from the shadows, the most powerful vampire to have ever existed.~
